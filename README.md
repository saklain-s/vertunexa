# Project: Math Quiz and Expense Manager

## Overview

I am very happy to share my first task. Let me explain the workflow of my project.

This Java project is a dual-functionality application built using Swing. It comprises two main modules:

1. **Math Quiz Module**: Generates random math problems (addition, subtraction, or multiplication) and tests the user's arithmetic skills.

## Features

### Math Quiz
- **Random Questions**: Generates random math problems.
- **User Interaction**: Users input their answer and receive immediate feedback.
- **Scoring**: Displays a score summary after completing a set of questions.
- **Navigation**: Easy navigation back to the main menu.



## Workflow

1. **Main Menu**: Upon launching the application, users see the Main Menu where they can choose to take the Math Quiz, manage their expenses, or exit the program.
2. **Math Quiz**: Users select the Math Quiz option to answer randomly generated math problems. They receive immediate feedback on their answers and see a final score summary after a set number of questions.
3. **Expense Manager**: Users select the Expense Manager option to manage their expenses. They can add new expenses, edit or delete existing entries, and view a summary report of their expenses.
4. **Navigation**: At any point, users can return to the Main Menu using the "Back to Main Menu" button provided in each module.
